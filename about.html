					</div>
				</div>

					<p>In the depths of my being, it is a challenge for me to encapsulate my journey in a few concise words. Allow me to embark on this narrative by recounting my early fascination with transforming the letters of my loved ones' names into abstract logos. Alternatively, I could commence with the grandiose theatrical performances I orchestrated in my room, where the mirror served as my captive audience. Then again, I might choose to share the profound personal exploration that unfolded through my early fixation on self-portraiture. Throughout my recollections, the driving forces of creativity and creation have ceaselessly infused love and joy into my heart. Whether it was my inaugural colouring set, my first camera, my mother's restoration and decoupage endeavours, or my father's keyboard and guitar… the act of drawing, colouring, cutting, gluing,  making things with my hands, dressing up, playing music, dancing, singing and photographing both myself and my creations has remained a cherished pursuit from the recesses of my memory.



						<p>The ability to alter my perspective has always provided me with a sense of movement—a dynamic impetus urging me forward and upward, towards novel realms of knowledge. I have forever embraced the role of perpetual learner, consistently seeking new avenues of understanding. For a time, I identified myself as a "Multipotentialite," a term coined by Emilie Wapnick to describe individuals with myriad interests and creative pursuits. Although I have often encountered criticism for desiring too much or being too much, I have challenged these notions, questioning: too much for whom, and in comparison to what?</p>
						
						
						
						<p>In due course, the realm of art and design emerged as my sanctuary of infinite possibilities—a space where I could wholeheartedly embody all that I aspired to become. Here, I could be a child, a creative force, a maker, both model and photographer, designer and illustrator, singer and writer, performer and coach. Presently, my work in design serves as a daily love letter to my younger self—an act of nurturing my playful spirit, preserving authenticity, and forging a legacy through my chosen methodology.</p>
						
						
						
						<p>While conventional expectations dictate that I outline my roles and accomplishments, I find it more compelling to unveil the essence of my journey. I left my home at the age of 19, armed with a diploma in Languages, driven by a relentless pursuit of self-discovery. My path led me to the vibrant city of London, where I ventured forth without a predetermined plan, eventually gaining admission to the esteemed London Metropolitan University. Graduating with an outstanding honours degree and an award in design research, I meandered through a multitude of jobs and life experiences. At times, anxiety clouded my confidence, suggesting that I was ill-suited for the freelance world and its manifold artistic domains.</p>

					<p>Yet, no matter where my path led, design persisted as an indomitable force flowing through my veins. In clothing stores, instead of simply fulfilling my role as a sales assistant, I curated shelves and styled mannequins with meticulous attention to detail, informed by astute market research. In startups, my creative endeavours surpassed the mere creation of visual identities, extending into the realm of experiential design and event planning. My purpose was to evoke profound emotional connections, leaving a lasting impression upon audiences. Even at the Apple store, amid a global pandemic, I rallied a small design team, collaborating to craft an official newsletter and a series of online workshops. Additionally, I embarked on the ambitious task of revamping the visual identity and internal communication materials for the Women @ Apple network, dedicated to fostering inclusion and diversity.</p>



						<p>In retrospect, as I look back on my journey, I have come to a profound realisation. While my jobs and achievements have played their part, they have never defined me as much as my identity as a creative. Through constant learning and honing of my crafts, I have sought to uncover creative solutions to everyday problems. But beyond that, my true purpose has been to evoke emotions within people, prompting them to ask profound questions and ultimately liberate themselves.</p>
						
						
						
						<p>Throughout my unconventional path, I have dared to venture beyond the boundaries of conventional discourse. I have embraced facets of my journey that some might deem unorthodox. However, it is within this uncharted territory that I have discovered my true essence. My identity does not reside in the titles or accolades bestowed upon me, but rather in my unwavering dedication to the pursuit of artistic expression and its transformative power.</p>
